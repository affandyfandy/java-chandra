| **Accept and Respond with JSON**      | Use JSON for request payload and responses. Set `Content-Type` to `application/json`. | Uses `@RequestBody` for JSON input and returns `ResponseEntity` with JSON. | Aligned.                                                                                               |
| **Use Nouns in Endpoint Paths**       | Use nouns in paths instead of verbs.                                                  | Uses `employee` and `department` as resource names in paths.               | Aligned.                                                                                               |
| **Logical Nesting on Endpoints**      | Nest related resources logically.                                                     | Uses logical nesting for endpoints like `upload` and `bydepartment`.       | Aligned.                                                                                               |
| **Handle Errors Gracefully**          | Return standard HTTP status codes with informative messages.                          | Implements status codes and messages in `ResponseEntity`.                  | Aligned.                                                                                               |
| **Filtering, Sorting, Pagination**    | Implement filtering, sorting, and pagination to manage large datasets.                | Includes filtering by department but lacks sorting and pagination.         | Partial alignment. Adding sorting and pagination would enhance functionality.                          |
| **Maintain Good Security Practices**  | Use SSL/TLS, role-based access control, and follow security best practices.           | Does not explicitly show security measures.                                | Needs improvement. Implement role-based access control and ensure all endpoints are served over HTTPS. |
| **Cache Data to Improve Performance** | Introduce caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data.                            | Does not include caching.                                                  | Needs improvement. Implement caching mechanisms like Redis or in-memory caching.                       |
| **Versioning APIs**                   | Use versioning in API paths to manage changes and ensure backward compatibility.      | Uses versioning in the endpoint paths (`/api/v1/employee`).                | Aligned.                                                                                               |
